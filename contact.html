      <h3>Tis I Jessie!</h3>
      <p>So My name is Jessie and im one of the newest students at <a href="https://www.correlation-one.com/" target="_blank">Correlation One</a> and this site it meant to showcase my purpose and mission within this class. I am an avid photographer and video editor who just got tired of the same thing and wanted more out of life. Many things in life can change and I just want to show you what im currently doing and how fun it can be to be a part of change. God and my family are all that I care about and I feel as if this class is what is going to help me achieve my goal to be able to start a family of my own.</p><br>

      <h3>Learn about Jessie Zuniga!</h3>
      <p>So I am a no nonsense pisces and peruvian/american who works at amazon specifically EWR7 as a Behind The Smiles Trainer. My job here is to onboard any new hires that join my shift which is Back Half Days, Wednesday to Saturday. I originally went to school for media production which taught me how to work with clients on projects that they wanted to complete which included pictures of clients and video production needs. Another fun fact about me is that I am colourblind which always lead to me having an interesting take when it came to using photoshop and colour grading. My personal habits and hobbies are very destructive which is why I always keep myself busy with work and social gatherings. As destructive as I am I always make sure that my mental health is first and foremost as to not fall into the despair that is life itself &#128517;</p><br>

      <h3>My Journey to Developer Valhalla</h3>
      <p>So there I am just minding my own business when another trainer comes by and mentions that they are interested in career choice. I mentioned to them that I always wanted to join but never really gave it too much thought about the process and what school to choose. They mentioned to me that they thought Correlation One was a good option if you are into tech and software. As some who frequently enjoy repairing tech I figured I wanted to see how it would be to develope software which plays into tech itself. So far the classes have been great and HTML is the foundation of software developement that I have been enjoying for the most part. With the introduciton to CSS many thing that use to confuse me are starting to come togethr like a puzzle and the instant gratification you get from your code coming out exactly how you hoped after troubleshooting it is just very rewarding overall. I honestly cant wait to see where this class takes me in life and its exciting to know that this opens up many opportunities for me to grow professionaly.</p><br><br>
